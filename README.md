# My Next.js Project

This is a **Next.js** project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).  
It is a modern, fast, and scalable web application built using the Next.js framework with optimized fonts and a structured file system.

## Project Description

- Server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR)
- Optimized font loading using `next/font`
- Modular and maintainable folder structure
